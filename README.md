With **squiral**, you can easily create a wide range of square spiral designs, from simple to complex.<br/>

**squiral** is easy to use and integrate into existing projects,<br/>
making it a great tool for data visualization, computer graphics, and other applications.<br/>
With **squiral**, you can quickly and easily generate square spiral patterns<br/>
that are both beautiful and functional.<br/>
Whether you're working on a personal project or a professional one,<br/>
**squiral**'s square spiral generator is the perfect tool<br/>
for adding unique and visually striking designs to your work.

The basic idea behind printing this matrix is<br/>
to start from the middle of the matrix and then moving:<br/>
`right` >> `down` >> `left` >> `up`<br/>
and not returning to the same row again.
